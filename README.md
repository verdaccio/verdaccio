# Version 5.x (Under development)

[Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) is a simple, **zero-config-required local private npm registry**.
No need for an entire database just to get started! Verdaccio comes out of the box with
**its own tiny database**, and the ability to proxy other registries (eg. npmjs.org),
caching the downloaded modules along the way.
For those looking to extend their storage capabilities, Verdaccio
**supports various community-made plugins to hook into services such as Amazon's s3,
Google Cloud Storage** or create your own plugin.
