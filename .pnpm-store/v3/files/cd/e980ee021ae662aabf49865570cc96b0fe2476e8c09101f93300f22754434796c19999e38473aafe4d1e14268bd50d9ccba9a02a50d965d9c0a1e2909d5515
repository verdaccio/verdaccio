## Install

```
$ npm install pino
```

## Usage

```js
const logger = require('pino')()

logger.info('hello world')

const child = logger.child({ a: 'property' })
child.info('hello child!')
```

This produces:

```
{"level":30,"time":1531171074631,"msg":"hello world","pid":657,"hostname":"Davids-MBP-3.fritz.box"}
{"level":30,"time":1531171082399,"msg":"hello child!","pid":657,"hostname":"Davids-MBP-3.fritz.box","a":"property"}
```

## Essentials

### Development Formatting

The [`pino-pretty`](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) module can be used to
format logs during development:

### Transports & Log Processing

Due to Node's single-threaded event-loop, it's highly recommended that sending,
alert triggering, reformatting and all forms of log processing
is conducted in a separate process. In Pino parlance we call all log processors
"transports", and recommend that the transports be run as separate
processes, piping the stdout of the application to the stdin of the transport.

For more details see our [Transports⇗](docs/transports.md) document.

### Low overhead

Using minimum resources for logging is very important. Log messages
tend to get added over time and this can lead to a throttling effect
on applications – such as reduced requests per second.

In many cases, Pino is over 5x faster than alternatives.

See the [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) document for comparisons.
