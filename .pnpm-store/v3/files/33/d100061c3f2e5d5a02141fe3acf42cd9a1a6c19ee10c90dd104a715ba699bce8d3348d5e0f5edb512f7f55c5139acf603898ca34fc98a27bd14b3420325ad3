## [2.0.1](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/compare/conventional-changelog-express@2.0.0...conventional-changelog-express@2.0.1) (2018-11-01)


### Bug Fixes

* Upgrade to Lerna 3, fix Node.js v11 error ([#385](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/385)) ([cdef282](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/commit/cdef282))

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/compare/conventional-changelog-express@1.0.0...conventional-changelog-express@2.0.0) (2018-06-06)


### Features

* re-use parser options within each preset ([#335](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/335)) ([d3eaacf](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/commit/d3eaacf)), closes [#241](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/241)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Re-use parser options object between components of a preset. For some
presets this may change the behavior of `conventional-recommended-bump`
as the parser options object for the `conventional-recommended-bump` options
within a preset were different than the parser options object for the
`conventional-changelog` options within a preset.

If you are not using `conventional-recommended-bump`, then this is
**not** a breaking change for you.
