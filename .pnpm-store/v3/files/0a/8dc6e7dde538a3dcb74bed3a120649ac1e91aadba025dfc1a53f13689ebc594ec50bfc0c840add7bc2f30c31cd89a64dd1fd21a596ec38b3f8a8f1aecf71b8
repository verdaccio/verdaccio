# @changesets/apply-release-plan

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`addd725`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/addd7256d9251d999251a7c16c0a0b068d557b5d) [#383](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/383) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added an experimental flag `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`. When set to `true`, we only bump peer dependents when peerDependencies are leaving range.

### Minor Changes

- [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04) [#371](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/371) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added support for ignoring packages in the `version` command. The version of ignored packages will not be bumped, but their dependencies will still be bumped normally. This is useful when you have private packages, e.g. packages under development. It allows you to make releases for the public packages without changing the version of your private packages. To use the feature, you can define the `ignore` array in the config file with the name of the packages:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "ignore": ["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]
    ...
  }
  ```

  or you can pass the package names to the `--ignore` flag when using cli:

  ```
  yarn changeset version --ignore pkg-a --ignore --pkg-b
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`addd725`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/addd7256d9251d999251a7c16c0a0b068d557b5d), [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04)]:
  - @changesets/config@1.2.0
  - @changesets/types@3.1.0

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6d0790a`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a) [#359](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/359) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Add support for snapshot flag to version command. Usage: `changeset version --snapshot [tag]`. The updated version of the packages looks like `0.0.0[-tag]-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, and SS is the date and time of when the snapshot version is created. You can use this feature with the tag option in the publish command to publish packages under experimental tags from feature branches. To publish a snapshot version of a package under an experimental tag you can do:

  ```
  $ # Version packages to snapshot version
  $ changeset version --snapshot
  $ # Publish packages under exprimental tag, keeping next and latest tag clean
  $ changeset publish --tag exprimental
  ```

## 3.0.3

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`52a88ce`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/52a88ce816692f6b18fa8f3f67d707b78b0b8210) [#361](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/361) Thanks [@Blasz](https://github.com/Blasz)! - Fix dependency release lines being output when they were skipped via the updateInternalDependencies config option

- [`2b49d66`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/2b49d668ecaa1333bc5c7c5be4648dda1b11528d) [#358](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/358) Thanks [@Blasz](https://github.com/Blasz)! - Add new updateInternalDependencies config option to disable auto bumping of internal dependencies in the same release if the dependency was only patch bumped

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`89f0c49`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/89f0c497ac21b8d008da67caff8032947836c7b1), [`2b49d66`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/2b49d668ecaa1333bc5c7c5be4648dda1b11528d), [`09f62f9`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/09f62f9c822f31899a48cbd93c7801d72a80b97e)]:

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [`3dbab2e`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/3dbab2e80d9a8a0cccc02d74c6d8150f603219e6) [#343](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/343) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - Self-references should be skipped when bumping versions. A self-reference is a dev dep that has the same name as the package. Some projects use self-references as a convinient way to require files using relative paths from the root directory.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`1706fb7`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/1706fb751ecc2f5a792c42f467b2063078d58716) [#321](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/321) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Fix TypeScript declarations

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`011d57f`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/011d57f1edf9e37f75a8bef4f918e72166af096e) [#313](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/313) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - Bumping `devDependencies` no longer bumps the packages that they depend on.

  This is a pretty big "quality of life" update, which means we will do fewer releases of packages overall, as there is no change of installed packages.

  This has been made a breaking chage as it changes the behaviour of what will be published. It should only be for the better, but we didn't want to surprise you with it.

* [`011d57f`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/011d57f1edf9e37f75a8bef4f918e72166af096e) [#313](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/313) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - Updates to devDependencies are not affecting the end users of a package. So we are not listing these changes in the changelog file.

### Minor Changes

- [`c3cc232`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/c3cc23204c6cb80487aced1b37ebe8ffde0e2111) [#311](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/311) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - Added support for workspace ranges. They are now correctly kept and updated when applying a release plan.

- Updated dependencies [[`011d57f`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/011d57f1edf9e37f75a8bef4f918e72166af096e)]:

This fixes an issue with package cycles.

### Patch Changes

- [`a679b1d`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/a679b1dcdcb56652d31536e2d6326ba02a9dfe62) [#204](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/204) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Correctly handle the 'access' flag for packages

  Previously, we had access as "public" or "private", access "private" isn't valid. This was a confusing because there are three states for publishing a package:

  - `private: true` - the package will not be published to npm (worked)
  - `access: public` - the package will be publicly published to npm (even if it uses a scope) (worked)
  - `access: restricted` - the package will be published to npm, but only visible/accessible by those who are part of the scope. This technically worked, but we were passing the wrong bit of information in.

  Now, we pass the correct access options `public` or `restricted`.
