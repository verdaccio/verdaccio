/**
 * Although lunr provides the ability to create queries using lunr.Query, it also provides a simple
 * query language which itself is parsed into an instance of lunr.Query.
 *
 * For programmatically building queries it is advised to directly use lunr.Query, the query language
 * is best used for human entered text rather than program generated text.
 *
 * At its simplest queries can just be a single term, e.g. `hello`, multiple terms are also supported
 * and will be combined with OR, e.g `hello world` will match documents that contain either 'hello'
 * or 'world', though those that contain both will rank higher in the results.
 *
 * Wildcards can be included in terms to match one or more unspecified characters, these wildcards can
 * be inserted anywhere within the term, and more than one wildcard can exist in a single term. Adding
 * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative
 * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.
 *
 * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term
 * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead
 * to an error being thrown.
 *
 * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms. A term
 * boost will make documents matching that term score higher, e.g. `foo^5`. Edit distance is also supported
 * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.
 * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.
 *
 * Each term also supports a presence modifier. By default a term's presence in document is optional, however
 * this can be changed to either required or prohibited. For a term's presence to be required in a document the
 * term should be prefixed with a '+', e.g. `+foo bar` is a search for documents that must contain 'foo' and
 * optionally contain 'bar'. Conversely a leading '-' sets the terms presence to prohibited, i.e. it must not
 * appear in a document, e.g. `-foo bar` is a search for documents that do not contain 'foo' but may contain 'bar'.
 *
 * To escape special characters the backslash character '\' can be used, this allows searches to include
 * characters that would normally be considered modifiers, e.g. `foo\~2` will search for a term "foo~2" instead
 * of attempting to apply a boost of 2 to the search term "foo".
 *
 * @typedef {string} lunr.Index~QueryString
 * @example <caption>Simple single term query</caption>
 * hello
 * @example <caption>Multiple term query</caption>
 * hello world
 * @example <caption>term scoped to a field</caption>
 * title:hello
 * @example <caption>term with a boost of 10</caption>
 * hello^10
 * @example <caption>term with an edit distance of 2</caption>
 * hello~2
 * @example <caption>terms with presence modifiers</caption>
 * -foo +bar baz
