# [4.0.0](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/compare/conventional-changelog-writer@3.0.9...conventional-changelog-writer@4.0.0) (2018-05-29)


### Chores

* **package:** set Node requirement to oldest supported LTS ([#329](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/329)) ([cae2fe0](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/commit/cae2fe0))


### Code Refactoring

* remove anchor from header templates ([#301](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/301)) ([346f24f](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/commit/346f24f)), closes [#186](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/186)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **package:** Set the package's minimum required Node version to be the oldest LTS
currently supported by the Node Release working group. At this time,
that is Node 6 (which is in its Maintenance LTS phase).
* Anchor tags are removed from the changelog header templates. The
rendered Markdown will no longer contain anchor tags proceeding the
version number header that constitutes the changelog header. This means
that consumers of rendered markdown will not be able to use a URL that
has been constructed to contain a version number anchor tag reference,
since the anchor tag won't exist in the rendered markdown.

It's stronly recomended consumers use the full URL path to the release
page for a given version, as that URL is a permalink to that verison,
contains all relavent release information, and does not, otherwise, rely
on the anchor tag being excessible from the current page view.

As an example, for version `2.0.0` of a GitHub project, the following
URL should be used:
- https://github.com/conventional-changelog/releaser-tools/releases/tag/v2.0.0

# [3.0.0](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-writer/compare/conventional-changelog-writer@2.0.3...conventional-changelog-writer@3.0.0) (2018-01-29)


### Bug Fixes

* **writer:** normalize release headings ([#237](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-writer/issues/237)) ([9e87dc3](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-writer/commit/9e87dc3)), closes [/github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/214#issuecomment-326681934](https://github.com//github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/issues/214/issues/issuecomment-326681934)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **writer:** Logic for generating release headings has been changed to make all
heading levels the same (`##`/`h2`) for better compatibility with
screen readers and parsers, and to conform to HTML semantics. Patch
release titles are now wrapped in a `<small>` tag to maintain the
visual hierarchy of the previous style.

### Performance Improvements

* **get/set:** drop dot-prop and just use lodash ([601e580](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-writer/commit/601e580))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **context:** `context.host` cannot change the default of `context.linkReferences` because if the host is unknown, `context.host` is `undefined` and all links will just use `context.repository`.
* The upstream must use the new api of `references` and `notes`.

`closes` now becomes `references`
The `notes` object is no longer a key-value object but an array of note object, such as
```js
{
title: 'BREAKING AMEND',
text: 'some breaking change'
}
```
* **notes:** `includeDetails` will only include `log` and `keyCommit`.
* **templates:** If `partials` is not empty, it should not ignore header, commit and footer partials.
* **reverse:** when there is no commits left for the last block of logs it will still try to generate one. (Assume commits might be rebased or lost but still need a new version).
* **noteGroups:** `options.noteGroups` is no longer available. Filter the notes from upstream or in `options.transform` instead.
* **notes:** `notes` in `noteGroups` is not an array of simple string any more but object. You must use `note.text` to access the equivalent of previous `note`.
* **cli:** Previously version number has to be passed as a flag. As a version number is compulsory, it does not make sense for a flag to be compulsory. So if a version number is passed as an input it is still valid.
* **transform:** `options.hashLength`, `options.maxSubjectLength` and `options.map` are deprecated in favour of `options.transform`.
* **map:** `options.replacements` is now `options.map` and it can also take functions
* **compareFunc:** commitGroupsCompareFn -> commitGroupsSort, commitsCompareFn -> commitsSort, noteGroupsCompareFn -> noteGroupsSort and notesCompareFn -> notesSort
* **compareFunc:** Default compare functions no longer sort by lexicographical order. They use `localeCompare` instead
* **version:** `version` is not a required field and it is moved to the `context` object. If version is found in the last commit, it will be overwritten.

### Bug Fixes

* **template:** default commit template should handle unkown host ([ef62bfd](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-writer/commit/ef62bfd))

### Features

* **context:** linkReferences has nothing to do with context.host ([f5883a6](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-writer/commit/f5883a6))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `context.host` cannot change the default of `context.linkReferences` because if the host is unknown, `context.host` is `undefined` and all links will just use `context.repository`.
