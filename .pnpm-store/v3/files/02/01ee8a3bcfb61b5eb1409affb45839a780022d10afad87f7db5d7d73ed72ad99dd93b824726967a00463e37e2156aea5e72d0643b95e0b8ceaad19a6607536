### Patch Changes

- [`a679b1d`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/a679b1dcdcb56652d31536e2d6326ba02a9dfe62) [#204](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/204) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Correctly handle the 'access' flag for packages

  Previously, we had access as "public" or "private", access "private" isn't valid. This was a confusing because there are three states for publishing a package:

  - `private: true` - the package will not be published to npm (worked)
  - `access: public` - the package will be publicly published to npm (even if it uses a scope) (worked)
  - `access: restricted` - the package will be published to npm, but only visible/accessible by those who are part of the scope. This technically worked, but we were passing the wrong bit of information in.

  Now, we pass the correct access options `public` or `restricted`.
