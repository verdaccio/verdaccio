## Special packages publish configurations
#publish:
## This will allow the publisher to publish packages even if any uplink is down.
#  allow_offline: true

# if you use nginx with custom path, use this to override links
#url_prefix: https://dev.company.local/verdaccio/

# You can specify listen address (or simply a port).
# If you add multiple values, verdaccio will listen on all of them.
#
# Examples:
#
#listen:
# - localhost:4873            # default value
# - http://localhost:4873     # same thing
# - 0.0.0.0:4873              # listen on all addresses (INADDR_ANY)
# - https://example.org:4873  # if you want to use https
# - [::1]:4873                # ipv6
# - unix:/tmp/verdaccio.sock    # unix socket

# Configure HTTPS, it is required if you use "https" protocol above.
#https:
#  key: path/to/server.key
#  cert: path/to/server.crt
#  ca: path/to/server.pem

# type: file | stdout | stderr
# level: trace | debug | info | http (default) | warn | error | fatal
#
# parameters for file: name is filename
#  {type: 'file', path: 'verdaccio.log', level: 'debug'},
# Rotating log stream. Options are passed directly to bunyan. See: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#stream-type-rotating-file
# {type: rotating-file, format: json, path: /path/to/log.jsonl, level: http, options: {period: 1d}}
# parameters for stdout and stderr: format: json | pretty | pretty-timestamped
#  {type: 'stdout', format: 'pretty', level: 'debug'},
logs:
  - {type: stdout, format: pretty, level: http}
  #- {type: file, path: verdaccio.log, level: info}

# you can specify proxy used with all requests in wget-like manner here
# (or set up ENV variables with the same name)
#http_proxy: http://something.local/

# Notify Settings
# Notify was built primarily to use with Slack's Incoming
# webhooks, but will also deliver a simple payload to
# any endpoint. Currently only active for publish / create
# commands.
#notify:
  # Choose a method. Technically this will accept any HTTP
  # request method, but probably stick to GET or POST
#  method: POST
  # Only run this notification if the package name matches the regular
  # expression
#  packagePattern: ^example-package$
  # Any flags to be used with the regular expression
#  packagePatternFlags: i
  # If this endpoint requires specific headers, set them here
  # as an array of key: value objects.
#  headers: [{'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}]
  # set the URL endpoint for this call
#  endpoint: https://hooks.slack.com/...
  # Finally, the content you will be sending in the body.
  # This data will first be run through Handlebars to parse
  # any Handlebar expressions. All data housed in the metadata object
  # is available for use within the expressions.
#  content: ' {{ handlebar-expression }}'
  # For Slack, follow the following format:
  # content: '{ "text": "Package *{{ name }}* published to version *{{ dist-tags.latest }}*", "username": "Verdaccio", "icon_emoji": ":package:" }'

  # Multiple notification endpoints can be created by specifying a collection
#  'example-package-1':
#    method: POST
    # Only run this notification if the package name matches the regular
    # expression
#    packagePattern: ^example-package-regex$
    # Any flags to be used with the regular expression
    # since verdaccio 2.2.2 this property has been disabled read #108
    # it will be re-enabled after 2.5.0
    # packagePatternFlags: i
    # If this endpoint requires specific headers, set them here
    # as an array of key: value objects.
    # headers supports as well a literal object
#    headers: {'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
