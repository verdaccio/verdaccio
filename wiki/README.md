## Why should I use verdaccio?👌


* I am/was **sinopia** user and need an **easy migration**.
* I need a lightweight and free solution 🎉 to host my private packages and no license worries 🎊.
* I need long-term support and help when I got stuck.
* I want a product compatible with the newer tools as **Yarn** and **DevOps (Docker, Ansible, Puppet, etc)** tools.
* An evolving plugabble product, not only for **Authentification**, also for **Storage** and more in the future.
* An active community 🙋‍♂️🙋.
* Integration with **Nexus**, **Artifactoy** and any other npm compatible registry.

### Why we forked from Sinopia? 🚀

It [appeared that sinopia maintenance had stalled and the author had abandoned it](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia/issues/376),
so there was a suggestion that the sinopia-using community would benefit
from a fresh look at the code and the outstanding issues. So here we are 🎉🎉🎉.  The last step about the [detach from sinopia](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/38).

### Near Future 🚧

`verdaccio` aims to be compatible with sinopia along the time preserving the main features, a lightweight app based on local file system and easy installation but being able to be pluggable and built over a modern tool stack.
