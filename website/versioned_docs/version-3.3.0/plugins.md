Verdaccio is an plugabble aplication. It can be extended in many ways, either new authentication methods, adding
endpoints or using a custom storage.

> If you are interested to develop your own plugin, read the [development](dev-plugins.md) section.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
$> npm install --global verdaccio-activedirectory
```
`verdaccio` as a sinopia fork it has backward compability with plugins that are compatible with `sinopia@1.4.0`. In such case the installation is the same.

```
$> npm install --global sinopia-memory
```

### Configuration

Open the `config.yaml` file and update the `auth` section as follows:

The default configuration looks like this, due we use a build-in `htpasswd` plugin by default that you can disable just commenting out the following lines.


### Auth Plugin Configuration

```yaml
 htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    #max_users: 1000
```

and replacing them with (in case you decide to use a `ldap` plugin.

```yaml
auth:
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```

#### Multiple Auth plugins

This is tecnically possible, the plugins order becames important, the the credentials will resolved in order.

```yaml
auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    #max_users: 1000
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```

### Middleware Plugin Configuration

This is an example how to set up a middleware plugin. All middleware plugins must be defined in the **middlewares** namespace.

```yaml
middlewares:
  audit:
    enabled: true
```

> You might follow the [audit middle plugin](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio-audit) as base example.

### Store Plugin Configuration

This is an example how to set up a storage plugin. All storage plugins must be defined in the **store** namespace.

```yaml
store:
  memory:
    limit: 1000
```

> If you define a custom store, the property **storage** in the configuration file will be ignored.
