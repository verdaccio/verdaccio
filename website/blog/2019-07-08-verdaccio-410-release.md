### [Filter plugin for packages](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/1161) by @mlucool {#filter-plugin-for-packages-by-mlucool}

Verdaccio now support plugin filters, we are just starting with filter metadata.

> It gets a current copy of a package metadata and may choose to modify it as required.
> For example, this may be used to block a bad version of a package or
> add a time delay from when new packages can be used from your
> registry. Errors in a filter will cause a 404, similar to upLinkErrors
> as it is not safe to recover gracefully from them.

The configuration would looks like

```yaml
filters:
  storage-filter-blackwhitelist:
    filter_file: /path/to/file
```

The current API for the plugin is

```javascript
interface IPluginStorageFilter<T> extends IPlugin<T> {
  filter_metadata(packageInfo: Package): Promise<Package>;
}
```

This system might be extended in the future, we are trying this approach at this stage.

### [parse YAML/JSON/JS config file](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/pull/1258) by @honzahommer {#parse-yamljsonjs-config-file-by-honzahommer}

Now, Verdaccio is able to understand JSON format for configuration files.

```bash
verdaccio --config /myPath/verdaccio.json
```
