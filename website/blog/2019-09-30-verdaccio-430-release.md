title: Release 4.3.0
---

Verdaccio keeps growing thanks to their users. This release is a minor one we do every month, further
[information about our releases can be read here](https://github.com/verdaccio/contributing/blob/master/RELEASES.md).

Furthermore, the info about the release is also available at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/releases/tag/v4.3.0).

We have some highlights to share:

- At this stage, Docker 🐳 pulls [have grown to **5.7 million pulls**](https://dockeri.co/image/verdaccio/verdaccio).
- We just reached **7.9k 🌟**, _would you help us to reach 10k?_ Give us your star ⭐️!
- **Blog** 🗒: Don't miss our new entry [**Managing multiple projects with Lerna and Yarn Workspaces**](https://verdaccio.org/blog/2019/09/07/managing-multiples-projects-with-lerna-and-yarn-workspaces) by [@sergiohgz](https://github.com/sergiohgz).
- **[Monorepo](https://github.com/verdaccio/monorepo)**: Along the last months we have crafted our monorepo for grouping all our ecosystem, plugin, core and tooling packages. This does not mean Verdaccio will become a monorepo, rather it will help us to grow without affecting the main repository and do easy updates or respond fast to mistakes in any release.
- **Hacktoberfest 🎃 is here**: We have prepared a guide if you want to contribute to Verdaccio, feel free to [read it](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/1461) and give us feedback.

## Experiment Flags {#experiment-flags}

This release includes a new property named `experiments` that can be placed in the `config.yaml` and is completely optional.

We want to be able to ship new things without affecting production environments. This flag allows us to add new features and get feedback from the community that wants to use them.

The features that are under this flag might not be stable or might be removed in future releases.

## New Features {#new-features}

### [Browse web packages by version](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/1457) by @juanpicado {#browse-web-packages-by-version-by-juanpicado}

When you publish a new version of your package, you want to be able to access the previous ones, that's exactly what you can do with this new release.

> Note the README always points to the latest release, Verdaccio does not persist the readme on each publish. This might change in the future, file a ticket if you are interested and might be considered if there is enough 👍🏻 votes.

### [npm token command support ](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/1427) by @juanpicado, @Eomm and @juangabreil. {#npm-token-command-support--by-juanpicado-eomm-and-juangabreil}

The command `npm token` is really useful to generate multiple tokens. This release ships some partial support for it and is flagged as **experiment**, to enable it you must do the following in your config file.

```yaml
experiments:
  token: true
```
