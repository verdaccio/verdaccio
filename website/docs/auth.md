The authentification is tied to the auth [plugin](plugins.md) you are using. The package restrictions also is handled by the [Package Access](packages.md).

The client authentification is handled by `npm` client itself. Once you login to the application:

```bash
npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873
```

A token is generated in the `npm` configuration file hosted in your user home folder. For more information about `.npmrc` read the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc).

```bash
cat .npmrc
registry=http://localhost:5555/
//localhost:5555/:_authToken="secretVerdaccioToken"
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=secretNpmjsToken
```

#### Anonymous publish

`verdaccio`allows you to enable anonymous publish, to achieve that you will need to set up correctly your [packages access](packages.md).

Eg:

```yaml
  'my-company-*':
    access: $anonymous
    publish: $anonymous
    proxy: npmjs
```

As is described [on issue #212](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/212#issuecomment-308578500) until `npm@5.3.0` and all minor releases **won't allow you publish without a token**.

## Understanding Groups

### The meaning of `$all` and `$anonymous`

As you know *Verdaccio* uses the `htpasswd` by default. That plugin does not implement the methods `allow_access`, `allow_publish` and `allow_unpublish`.
Thus, *Verdaccio* will handle that in the following way:

* If you are not logged in (you are anonymous), `$all` and `$anonymous` means exactly the same.
* If you are logged in, `$anonymous` won't be part of your groups and `$all` will match any logged user. A new group `$authenticated` will be added to the list.

As a takeaway, `$all` **will match all users, independently whether is logged or not**.

**The previous behavior only applies to the default authentication plugin**. If you are using a custom plugin and such plugin implements
`allow_access`, `allow_publish` or `allow_unpublish`, the resolution of the access depends on the plugin itself. Verdaccio will only set the default groups.

Let's recap:

* **logged**: `$all`, `$authenticated`, + groups added by the plugin
* **anonymous (logged out)**: `$all` and `$anonymous`.

## Default htpasswd

In order to simplify the setup, `verdaccio` use a plugin based on `htpasswd`. Since version v3.0.x the `verdaccio-htpasswd` plugin
is used by default.

```yaml
auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    # Maximum amount of users allowed to register, defaults to "+inf".
    # You can set this to -1 to disable registration.
    #max_users: 1000
```

Property | Type | Required | Example | Support | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
file | string | Yes | ./htpasswd | all | file that host the encrypted credentials
max_users | number | No | 1000 | all | set limit of users

In case to decide do not allow user to login, you can set `max_users: -1`.
