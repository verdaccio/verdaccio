Verdaccio is a pluggable application. It can be extended in many ways, either new authentication methods, adding endpoints or using a custom storage.

There are 5 types of plugins:

* [Authentication](plugin-auth.md)
* [Middleware](plugin-middleware.md)
* [Storage](plugin-storage.md)
* Custom Theme and filters

> If you are interested to develop your own plugin, read the [development](dev-plugins.md) section.

## Usage {#usage}

### Installation {#installation}

```bash
$> npm install --global verdaccio-activedirectory
```

`verdaccio` as a sinopia fork it has backward compability with plugins that are compatible with `sinopia@1.4.0`. In such case the installation is the same.

```
$> npm install --global sinopia-memory
```

### Configuration {#configuration}

Open the `config.yaml` file and update the `auth` section as follows:

The default configuration looks like this, due we use a build-in `htpasswd` plugin by default that you can disable just commenting out the following lines.


### Authentication Configuration {#authentication-configuration}

```yaml
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    # max_users: 1000
```

and replacing them with (in case you decide to use a `ldap` plugin.

```yaml
auth:
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```

#### Multiple Authentication plugins {#multiple-authentication-plugins}

This is technically possible, making the plugin order important, as the credentials will be resolved in order.

```yaml
auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    #max_users: 1000
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```

### Middleware Configuration {#middleware-configuration}

This is an example how to set up a middleware plugin. All middleware plugins must be defined in the **middlewares** namespace.

```yaml
middlewares:
  audit:
    enabled: true
```

> You might follow the [audit middle plugin](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio-audit) as base example.

### Storage Configuration {#storage-configuration}

This is an example how to set up a storage plugin. All storage plugins must be defined in the **store** namespace.

```yaml
store:
  memory:
    limit: 1000
```

### Theme Configuration {#theme-configuration}

Verdaccio allows to replace the User Interface with a custom one, we call it **theme**.
By default, uses `@verdaccio/ui-theme` that comes built-in, but, you can use something different installing your own plugin.

```bash

$> npm install --global verdaccio-theme-dark

```

> The plugin name prefix must start with `verdaccio-theme`, otherwise the plugin won't load.


You can load only one theme at a time and pass through options if you need it.

```yaml
theme:
  dark:
    option1: foo
    option2: bar
```
